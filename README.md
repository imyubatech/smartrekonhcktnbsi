A high-end user-centric Android application engineered with Jetpack Compose and a modular architecture, developed as part of the BSI Hackathon.

## Description

**[Smart Rekon]**, also known as **Smart Recon Apps**, is a sophisticated Android application designed for the streamlined monitoring of vendor-submitted documents. The application categorizes documents into three distinct states: **Waiting List Document**, **Approved Document**, and **Rejected Document**.

Leveraging the declarative UI paradigm of Jetpack Compose, the application provides an intuitive and efficient interface for high-end users. Its modular architecture ensures a robust and maintainable codebase, facilitating scalability and independent feature development. The core functionality includes comprehensive dashboards and detailed views, significantly enhancing the ease with which users can monitor the status and details of submitted documents.

## Key Features

* **Real-time Document Monitoring:** Provides up-to-date status of vendor documents across the defined states.
* **Categorized Document Status:** Clearly segregates documents into Waiting List, Approved, and Rejected categories for efficient tracking.
* **Intuitive Dashboards:** Offers a centralized overview of document statuses and key metrics.
* **Detailed Document Views:** Enables users to access comprehensive information for each submitted document.
* **High-End User Focus:** Designed with an emphasis on performance, efficiency, and a sophisticated user experience for professional users.
* **Modular Design:** Facilitates independent development, testing, and deployment of application features.
* **[Add other specific technical features, e.g., API integration details, data synchronization mechanisms, etc.]**

## Architecture

This application adheres to a modular architectural pattern, decoupling distinct features and functionalities into independent modules. This approach yields several technical advantages:

* **Enhanced Code Organization:** Feature-specific modules improve codebase clarity and maintainability.
* **Increased Reusability:** Independent modules can be potentially reused across different parts of the application or in other projects.
* **Improved Build Times (Potentially):** Modifications within a single module may not necessitate a full application rebuild.
* **Efficient Team Collaboration:** Separate teams can concurrently work on different modules with reduced integration complexities.

## Technologies Used

* **Jetpack Compose:** Android’s modern declarative UI toolkit for building native user interfaces.
* **Kotlin:** A concise, safe, and expressive programming language for Android development.
* **[List other specific libraries/frameworks used, e.g., Retrofit for networking, Room Persistence Library for data storage, Dependency Injection frameworks like Hilt, etc., and briefly mention their technical role.]**
